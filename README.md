To use it, type the following command in your project root:

```
After this, a new folder called utils will appear in your project. You need to commit it with your code.

To use any function inside this module you need to import it as in this example:
```python
from utils.liferay_utils.jira_utils.jira_liferay import get_jira_connection
```
